## Nichole Sullivan - Adventure Scientist
I’m Nichole Sullivan, a multi-disciplinary scientist and self appointed adventure scientist. *Adventure Scientist* is a unique self identification that captures my willingness to try new things, push boundaries, and say yes, with my passion for experimentation, observation, and learning.

I have a formal comprehensive physical science background and a lifetime of building and tinkering including
building custom pieces for farming needs and scientific instruments. I've coded numerous multi-physics models to describe real-world experiments, led atrificial intelligence projects,
developed prototypes, and tinkered with web development in many platforms.

With diverse R&D experiences I have a wide range of wet laboratory and computer science skills, in a wide range of scientific fields. I have specalized in identifying and applying emerging technologies across different disciplines, bringing them togther, and appying them to problems in the idustry sector.

### Interests

I’m interested in just about everything. As an avid reader another huge source of inspiration is stories, most notably science fiction. The exposure to other people’s imagination, 
in all genres pushes me to think more creatively and make connections is seemingly unconnected domains. If I had to sum up what inspires me in one, it would be diversity. 

Diversity in exposure, diversity in schooling, diversity in socialization. The more I learn and experience world from different perspectives, the more fodder I have for new ideas. 

I’m currently learning nodejs & react.

I’m looking to collaborate on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Digital Twins (DT). Due to company IP I don't have anything regarding these on github... yet.
